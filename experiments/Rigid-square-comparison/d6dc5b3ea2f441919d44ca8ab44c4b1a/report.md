# Rigid-square comparison

State: **COMPLETED**. Square count: 11.

Completed candidate evaluations: 7176/1000000.
Scientific episode executions: 459584. Submitted attempts: 459584.
Diagnostic replays: 5; cached-parent reuse: 7.

Every ranked best pose is independently CPU validated. Native NPZ chunks preserve exact FP32 best/current geometry and defined VM/result fields.
Training winners are frozen before untouched holdout. A valid construction supports an upper bound; this functional pilot makes no optimality or method-superiority claim.

Native replay comparison checks best/current endpoints, defined fields, RNG and work; it does not certify unrecorded intermediate states.
